# Duet Fonts

This package includes Duet Fonts and related tools.

## Usage

For usage instructions, please see Duet Design System [documentation](https://www.duetds.com/typography/).

## How to update/add a new font

- If you need to add a new font, place it inside src/assets directory following the existing naming convention.
- You will need at least .woff2 and .woff file formats, but we recommend including .eot as well for consistency.
- Once your assets are added, you need to modify the .css, .less and .scss files under the src directory to include imports to these new files.
