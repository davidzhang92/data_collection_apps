# Duet CSS

This package includes Duet CSS Framework and related tools.

## Usage

For usage instructions, please see Duet Design System [documentation](https://www.duetds.com/css-framework/).

## Architecture

This package uses SCSS for authoring, npm for building, and dart-sass/sass-lint for linting.

The package consists of the following:

* `_breakpoints.scss` offers a helper class to display the currently-matched media query.
* `_components.scss` hides all Duet components until they are loaded. It is auto-generated as part of the `components` package's build
* `_tokens.scss` exposes Duet design tokens as CSS classes
* `_utilities.scss` offers a number of utility classes for common scenarios
