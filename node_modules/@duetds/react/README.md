# React wrapper for @duetds/components

This package includes React specific wrapper for Duet Components.

## Usage

For usage instructions, please see Duet Design System [documentation](https://www.duetds.com/using-components/#usage-with-react).

## Architecture

All files under `src/` (except `index.ts`) are auto-generated as part of the `components` package's build. These are generated by the `react-output-target`.

On build, the auto-generated Typescript files are compiled to both ES Modules and CommonJS modules. CommonJS was added to support consuming the package from Next.js apps.
